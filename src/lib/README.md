Can There Be Other Things in src/?
Absolutely! The src/ folder is your root for all project files, so it’s not restricted to app/. You can organize other files however you want, such as:

Shared Resources:

```
src/assets/: Store images, fonts, or icons (though assets like these are often moved to public/ for easier direct access).
src/styles/: Centralize all your global and reusable CSS/SCSS/Tailwind styles here.
```

Reusable Logic:

```
src/lib/: A common convention for utility functions, hooks, or shared logic across the app.
bash

src/lib/
├── api.ts # API helper functions
├── hooks/
└── utils.ts # Utility functions
```

Context Providers:

```
Store React Context providers or Zustand stores in a dedicated folder like src/context/ or src/store/.
```

Test Files:

```
Unit and integration tests can live under src/tests/.
Other Modules:

Example: You could have src/components/ for shared components that don’t directly belong in app/.
```
